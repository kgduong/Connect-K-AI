# Connect-K-AI

## Project Description

ConnectK is an enhanced version of Connect4 the board game. ConnectK's width (w), height (h), and K are all configurable. ConnectK is also more interesting as it supports 2 different gravity modes: ON | OFF. With gravity off, the pieces stay wherever they are placed. With gravity on, they fall till they meet another piece or hit the bottom.
